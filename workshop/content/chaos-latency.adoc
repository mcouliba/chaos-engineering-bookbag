= Chaos Experiment 1: Network latency

_30 MINUTE PRACTICE_

In production, it is more common to have slow services than broken services. **Latency** measures the delay between an action and a response. For this first experiment, we will test the following hypothesis:

_**A small network latency should not impact the Service Level Objective (SLO) of the Travel Service**_

== Define the steady state


In the {GRAFANA_URL}[Chaos Engineering Dashboard, role='params-link'], you can analyze the different metrics and define the Steady State for our chaos experiment.
First, `*select the following variables on the dashboard*`:

.Dashboard Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Namespace 
|**chaos-engineering{USER_ID}**
|

|Service
|**travels.chaos-engineering{USER_ID}.svc.cluster.local**
|

|===

image::images/grafana-chaos-selection.png[Grafana - Chaos Selection,400]

From the **Namespace section**, you can tell that **99% of requests are successful and served within 50 ms**  

image::images/grafana-steady-state-latency.png[Grafana - Steady State Latency,900]

So we will define this SLO as "steady-state".

`*Click on 'Service Overview' > Edit*`

image::images/grafana-edit-service-overview.png[Grafana - Edit Service Overview,300]

Then, `*click on 'Visualization Settings' icon on the left hand sidebar, scroll down to find the 'P99 Latency (Value #D)' rule and enter the following information for Thresholds*`

.P99 Latency Thresholds Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Thresholds 
|**50,100**
|

|Color Mode
|**Cell**
|

|Colors
|**Green/Yellow/Red** (click on the 'invert' button if needed)
|

|===

image::images/grafana-p99-latency-threholds.png[Grafana - P99 Latency Threholds,700]

`*Scroll down again and to find the 'Success Rate (Value #E)' rule and enter the following information for Thresholds*`

.Success Rate Thresholds Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Thresholds 
|**0.95,0.99**
|

|Color Mode
|**Cell**
|

|Colors
|**Red/Yellow/Green** (click on the 'invert' button if needed)
|

|===

image::images/grafana-success-rate-threholds.png[Grafana - Sucess Rate Threholds,700]

Once done, you should have the following outcome (all green).

image::images/grafana-service-overview-configured.png[Grafana - Service Overview Configured,700]

`*Click on the 'Disk' icon to save and go back to the Dashboard.*`

== Run the Chaos experiment

In the {KIALI_URL}[Kiali Console^, role='params-link'], from the **'Graph' view**, `*right-click on the 'discounts' service and select 'Details'*`

image::images/kiali-right-click-service.png[Kiali - Right Click Service,400]

You will be redirected to the Service Details page. 

`*Click on the 'Actions' > 'Fault Injection'*`

image::images/kiali-add-fault-injection.png[Kiali - Add Fault Injection,900]

`*Add HTTP Delay by entering the following settings:*`

.HTTP Delay Settings
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value
|Description

|Add HTTP Delay 
|**Enabled**
|

|Delay Percentage
|**5**
|

|Fixed Delayed
|**1s**
|

|===

image::images/kiali-configure-latency.png[Kiali - Configure Latency,400]

`*Click on the 'Update' button*`. 

**5% of the traffic of the 'discounts' service has now 1 second of delay.**

== Analyze the Chaos outcome

Now let's see the impact of the application.

In the {GRAFANA_URL}[Chaos Engineering Dashboard], you can see the result of the chaos experiment.

image::images/grafana-latency-fault-overview.png[Grafana - Latency Fault Overview,900]

From the **'Service Overview'** panel or **'Request Duration'** for the 'travels' service, you can tell the following about the small network latency based on our hypothesis:

- there is no impact on the Success Rate of the overall requests (100%)
- there is a huge impact on the performance of the application. 

Indeed, just 1 second of delay on 5% of the traffic of one dependant service induces **a latency propagation of ~2 seconds across the entire system**.

image::images/grafana-latency-fault-details.png[Grafana - Latency Fault Details,900]

In conclusion, you can tell **the application is not resilient to a small network latency**. To reduce or fix this phenomenon, you could configure the autoscaling or implement a cache mechanism across the different services of the applications.

== Improve the Resiliency

To contain this latency propagation, you are going to apply the *Retry* pattern to all services calling the delayed 'discounts' services.

Retries can improve the application resiliency against transcient problems such as  a temporarily overloaded service or network like we simulate in our experiment.

Instead of failing directly or waiting too long, we could retry N number of times to get the desired output with the desired response time before considering as failed.

`*Configure the Retry pattern for the following services*`

== Validate the Improvement

Back into the {GRAFANA_URL}[Chaos Engineering Dashboard], you can tell that we manage to contain the Latency propagation by **not exceeding 100 ms in general** using the Retry pattern while the 'discounts' service still has the 1s latency issue.

image::images/grafana-latency-contained-overview.png[Grafana - Latency Contained Overview,900]

You can see more detail on the 'Request Duration' panel for the 'travels' service

== Rollback the Chaos experiment

There is nothing more simple than rollbacking all configurations you have done during this lab with Argo CD.

In {GITOPS_URL}[Argo CD^, role='params-link'], `*click on 'Sync > Synchronize'*`.

image::images/argocd-rollback-sync.png[Argo CD - Sync Application, 900]

Finally, in the {GRAFANA_URL}[Chaos Engineering Dashboard], `*please check the application is back in the steady state*`.
